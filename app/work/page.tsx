      <h1>No Meetings, No Deadlines, No Full-Time Employees</h1>

      <p>
        I started Gumroad in 2011. In 2015, we reached a peak of 23 full-time
        employees. In 2016, after <Link href="/reflecting">failing</Link> to raise
        more money, I ended up back where I began: a one-person company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, when I'm asked how many people work at Gumroad, I respond with
        "ten or so." That's how I convert the number of people we have into
        what others expect. But the truth is more complicated:
      </p>
      <p>If we include everyone who works on Gumroad, it's 25.</p>
      <p>If we include full-time employees, it's none. Not even me.</p>
      <p>We have no meetings, and no deadlines either.</p>
      <p>
        And it's working: our creators earn over $175 million a year, and we
        generate $11 million in annualized revenue, growing 85%
        year-over-year.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/2020-earnings.png"
        alt="2020 earnings"
        className="max-w-full my-4 mx-auto"
      />
      <p>
        That said, I don't expect anyone to copy our way of working wholesale.
        We got here on accident, not some grand plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I do think there are pieces of our story and the way we work
        that could benefit other companies, their people, and&mdash;most
        importantly&mdash;their customers.
      </p>
      <h2>Freedom at all costs</h2>
      <p>
        After the layoffs in 2015, even though the team shrunk, Gumroad itself
        continued to grow.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/2018-earnings.png"
        alt="2018 earnings"
        className="max-w-full my-4 mx-auto"
      />
      <p>
        But hiring people full-time and leasing a new office in San Francisco
        to work out of was untenable. Instead, I found an Indian firm called{" "}
        <Link href="https://bigbinary.com/">BigBinary</Link> and hired a few
        engineers as contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
        These contractors saved the company. They fixed bugs and maintained
        the site while I answered support tickets, designed features, and
        wrote about new initatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I hired back the same customer support person we had from
        before the layoffs, this time via an hourly contracting agreement too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, I <Link href="/bubble">moved to Utah</Link> and attempted to
        become a full-time creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Gumroad was no longer on track to become a billion-dollar
        company, I acquired a new asset: time. I used that time to take
        classes on writing and painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I was burned out and didn't want to think about working any
        more than I needed to, I instituted a no-meeting, no-deadline culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, it was no longer about growth at all costs, but "freedom at
        all costs."
      </p>
      <p>
        This way, Gumroad stayed profitable, I could take a much-needed break
        to explore my hobbies, and the product continued to improve over time.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/operating.png"
        alt="Operating expenses versus creator earnings chart"
        className="max-w-full my-4 mx-auto"
      />
      <h2>How we work</h2>
      <p>
        Today, working at Gumroad resembles working on an open source project
        like Rails. Except it's neither open source, nor unpaid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of having meetings, people "talk" to each other via GitHub,
        Notion, and (occasionally) Slack, expecting responses within 24 hours.
        Because there are no standups or "syncs" and some projects can involve
        expensive feedback loops to collaborate, working this way requires
        clear and thoughtful communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone writes well, and writes <em>a lot</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no deadlines either. We ship incrementally, and launch
        things whenever the stuff in development is better than what's
        currently in production. The occasional exception does exist, such as
        a tax deadline, but as a rule, I try not to tell anyone what to do or
        how fast to do it. When someone new joins the company, they do what
        everyone else does: go into our Notion queue, pick a task, and get to
        work, asking for clarification when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of setting quarterly goals or using OKRs, we move towards a
        single north star: maximizing how much money creators earn. It's
        simple and measurable, allowing anyone in the company to do the math
        on how much a feature or bug-fix might be worth.
      </p>
      <p>But we don't prioritize ruthlessly.</p>
      <p>
        People can work on what's fun or rely on their intuition, because as
        long as we remain profitable and keep shipping, we tend to get to the
        important stuff eventually. Our{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNes_Qfo0gw">
          public board meetings
        </Link>{" "}
        help Gumroad's creators hold us accountable.
      </p>
      <p>We ship big things this way too.</p>
      <p>
        In November 2020, we shipped{" "}
        <Link href="https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/introducing-gumroad-memberships">
          Gumroad Memberships
        </Link>
        , a year in the works and now used by hundreds of creators to earn
        over $1,500,000 per month.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a screenshot from our roadmap to show what it looks like in
        practice:
      </p>
      <img
        src="/memberships-roadmap.png"
        alt="Memberships roadmap"
        className="max-w-full my-4 mx-auto"
      />
      <p>
        For more, I recorded{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PcIC1DKBU0">
          an hour-long video
        </Link>{" "}
        about how we ship something as large as Gumroad Memberships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gumroad engineer Helen Hood, who shipped Memberships, says, "it's one
        of the biggest product launches of my career, and we shipped it
        without a single meeting or video call. I've worked at your typical
        startup, with an open floor plan, lots of whiteboards, standups and
        sprint planning, beers after work. I've also worked on a remote team
        with little communication and engineers largely siloed on their own
        projects. The way we work at Gumroad is ideal for me. It lets me
        maximize my productive hours, and clock out when I've hit my limit."
      </p>
      <p>
        Those are the broad strokes, but we've published more specific
        documentation about{" "}
        <Link href="https://jobs.gumroad.com/">the way we work</Link>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>How do we decide what to work on?</strong>
          <p>
            "At the end of the day there's a lot of emotion that goes into
            Gumroad, that's not dissimilar from an art project. We sometimes
            pick what's fun and feels good to work on! We love listening to
            creators! We don't do tons of data analysis to decide what's worth
            working on."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How do we communicate?</strong>
          <p>"Turn off all notifications from your phone!"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What does working at Gumroad feel like?</strong>
          <p>
            "We ship incrementally, iteratively, and have one massive tentpole
            launch a year. Every month we see how much creators got paid, then
            we move on. The journey is the fun part, we're not waiting to
            arrive at some destination."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What's not so good at Gumroad?</strong>
          <p>
            "There's not a lot of room for growth. We're staying profitable,
            and not planning to double the team every year. While there will
            likely be a few leadership roles, there aren't plenty of them and
            they aren't built into the career path of working at Gumroad."
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Gumroad's Chris Maximin says, "this way to work is responsible for the
        highest level of productivity I've ever experienced. The ability to
        focus on actual work creates a virtuous circle benefiting both the
        company and the workers: 1) the company does not have to pay expensive
        engineers to sit around in endless, useless meetings, and 2) the
        engineers get to do more and learn more, which benefits them in the
        long term."
      </p>
      <p>This isn't just for engineers.</p>
      <p>
        Justin Mikolay, a writer at Gumroad, ships each of our{" "}
        <Link href="https://gumroad.com/l/BCMDz">Creator Spotlights</Link> this way,
        even though each one requires at least three people&mdash;plus the
        creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Everything</em> is handled this way: support, risk, content,
        growth, product prioritization, board decks, design feedback, and
        more.
      </p>

      <h2>Minimum viable culture</h2>
      <p>This way of working isn't for everyone.</p>
      <p>
        There are no retreats planned, and no social channels in Slack. There
        are limited opportunities for growth. And we can't compete with the
        comp packages that big tech companies can provide.
      </p>
      <p>But we can compete&mdash;and win&mdash;on flexibility.</p>
      <p>
        <Link href="https://twitter.com/sidyadav">Sid Yadav</Link>, former VP of
        Product at Teachable, joined Gumroad in 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his words, "most entrepreneurs have two options: work a full-time
        job and hustle nights/weekends, or leave your job and risk everything
        to start the company. Gumroad provided a third way: I could contract
        20-35 hours a week, and for a couple days a week, incubate ideas and
        work on my next thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020, Sid left Gumroad to start his own creator economy company,{" "}
        <Link href="https://circle.so">Circle</Link>, together with former Gumroad
        coworker{" "}

      </p>
      <Tweet id="1216761573479473152" />
      <p>Working on Gumroad isn't a majority of anyone's identity.</p>
      <p>
        People work at Gumroad as little as they need to sustain the other
        parts of their lives they prefer to spend their time and energy on: a
        creative side-hustle, their family, or anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gumroad engineer Nathan Chan says, "I produce more value for my time
        than at any other company in my career, and I'm able to fully
        participate in parenting and watching my kiddo grow up."
      </p>
      <p>That includes me.</p>
      <p>
        From 2011 to 2016, building Gumroad was my singular focus in life. But
        today, it is just a part of my life, like a hobby might be. For
        example, I paint for fun, and every once in a while, I sell a
        painting.
      </p>
      <h2>A company of creators</h2>
      <p>
        One day, out of the blue, I received an email from{" "}
        <Link href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</Link>. I knew
        Daniel; he was a creator who had made over $250,000 on Gumroad in less
        than a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was already using the product&mdash;so he understood what problems
        Gumroad ought to solve next&mdash;and he had some ideas for how he
        could help out:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I love Gumroad (and I'm living off it!), I enjoy product scoping and
        strategy, and I think I can take over your PM tasks. I would only be
        able to dedicate around 2hrs/day on average, but I'd be available
        daily. Don't know if this is the type of commitment you had in mind,
        but I figured if there's a place where this arrangement can work, it's
        Gumroad :)
      </blockquote>
      <p>It was a perfect fit. Daniel became our new Head of Product.</p>
      <p>
        It can be a great deal for Gumroad too. Before Daniel quit his job at
        Amazon, he was making over $400,000 a year. We pay him $120,000 a
        year.
      </p>
      <p>How? He works ten hours a week for us. In his words:</p>
      <Tweet id="1334288446697865216" />
      <h2>Getting paid</h2>
      <p>
        In practice, we pay everyone hourly based on their role. The range
        varies from $50 (customer support) to $250 (Head of Product) an hour.
      </p>
      <p>Recently I standardized our rates world-wide:</p>
      <Tweet id="1334201934702493697" />
      <p>This rate is agreed upon during our interview process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply via a form.</li>
        <li>
          An unpaid, few-hour challenge, that resembles the high-level work we
          do at Gumroad. This may include breaking down a large shipment (like
          Gumroad Memberships) into its atomic parts, planning the schema
          associated with a new feature, or writing up a Help Center article.
        </li>
        <li>
          A paid, few-week trial period, that resembles the day-to-day work we
          do at Gumroad. This may include fixing bugs, shipping a feature, or
          answering support tickets.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>
          Note: We'll be hiring for more positions soon!{" "}
          <Link href="https://twitter.com/shl">Follow me on Twitter</Link> for
          updates.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the company, we keep a document that lists how much everyone is
        paid, along with their average working hours. This allows the team to
        have as much information as I do when making compensation decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no perks of any kind, besides the flexibility and the cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be clear, we don't provide healthcare. Everyone who works at
        Gumroad is responsible for their own healthcare and benefits. Everyone
        also pays for their own phone, laptop, internet connection, and all
        the other things they need.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is another downside to this system: people have to track their
        hours. Some people solve this by billing 20 hours a week, even though
        they may work a bit more or a bit less. Others track it diligently, in
        15-minute increments, and send a detailed invoice every week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Daniel joined as quarter-time Head of Product, we've had{" "}
        <Link href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna">Randall Kanna</Link> join as
        quarter-time Head of Community and{" "}
        <Link href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely">Philip Kiely</Link> join as
        quarter-time Head of Marketing. They're successful Gumroad creators
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, it clicked: Creators make money so they can make stuff,
        instead of the other way around. Why not adopt this framing at
        Gumroad, too?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what <em>working in the creator economy</em> should feel like.
      </p>
      <h2>The future of work is not working</h2>
      <p>
        Recently, I pitched the whole company about going full-time, because
        it felt wrong to grow any larger without full-time staff.
      </p>
      <p>Nobody accepted.</p>
      <p>
        I realized then that I was trying to copy the status quo&mdash;to try
        and fix something that wasn't broken&mdash;so that I could feel better
        about doing things the "normal" way.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the deal we already had in place was better for what our people
        prioritize: freedom over growth, sustainability over speed, life over
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <Link href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad's homepage</Link> is clear about
        its benefits to creators who use it: "Escape your 9-to-5 job. Take off
        your suit and tie. End your commute. Get paid for your craft."
      </p>
      <p>
        As cliché as it may be, we are trying to be a company of creators, for
        creators.
