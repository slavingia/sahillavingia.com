        <h1>God Mode</h1>

        <p>
          A few weeks ago, Paul Graham published Founder Mode, about a
          management style practiced by Brian Chesky at Airbnb that was at least
          partially inspired by Steve Jobs.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Paul states in Founder Mode, "It seems to be working. Airbnb's free
          cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley."
        </p>

        <p>
          So, what is founder mode? The article rang true to me, but was
          purposefully unspecific.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my attempt at proposing something more truthful by being more
          specific: god mode.
        </p>

        <h2>Growth, optimization, destruction</h2>

        <p>Every startup focuses on growth at its outset.</p>

        <p>They often raise money in order to focus exclusively on that.</p>

        <p>
          Eventually, the growth tapers out and the founders start focusing on
          optimization.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's what Paul refers to in his essay as "manager mode," which is
          already commonly taught in business school and practiced in all kinds
          of businesses around the world. Therefore, optimization isn't enough
          to build the singular businesses investors like Paul are hoping to
          invest in.
        </p>

        <p>The third point of god mode defines founder mode: destruction.</p>

        <p>
          Destruction is akin to invasive surgery, and similar to surgery, it's
          only possible with a god-like omniscience about the entire system.
          Hence, god mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          (This also means that god mode is only possible within the rare
          businesses where a single person can have complete omniscience about
          their business; companies like Gumroad and Airbnb.)
        </p>

        <h2>From Dead to Alive</h2>

        <p>
          In 2023, Gumroad doubled "our" pricing to 10% flat. But really, I did.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one else would have made the same decision–it put the entire
          company at risk. But from my perspective, the entire company was
          already dead, and I needed to do something aggressive to save it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before doing so, I asked my team, top customers, and many of our
          investors whether it was a good idea. No one thought so. It turns out,
          no one agreed with me that increasing our pricing so drastically and
          dramatically–and directly, I went with an email blast titled "simpler,
          higher pricing"–was a good idea, but I believed it was the right thing
          to do, and did it anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          (Why ask them then? Because they could have changed my mind. While I
          didn't have to follow their advice, it was important to make sure I
          wasn't missing something. I've disbanded many dramatic ideas due to
          feedback.)
        </p>

        <p>I was able to do this because:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I'm a solo founder. I didn't have to convince anyone</li>
          <li>
            No one was going to stop me; everyone had a remote job they wanted
            to keep
          </li>
          <li>I could do it myself; I'm technical</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          None of this comes off as super likable. And it's not fun to be
          disliked. It paints "founder mode" vs "manager mode" as something more
          like "dictatorship" vs "democracy."
        </p>

        <p>
          But when your company is on the brink, you'll do what's necessary to
          save it. If that requires becoming a benevolent dictator, like Lee
          Yuan Yew had to do to resurrect Singapore, it becomes worth it.
        </p>

        <p>And actions like that do seem to require dictators.</p>

        <p>
          For example, it's interesting to me that Paul doesn't use the term
          "cofounder" anywhere in the article, even though most
          founders–including Brian Chesky–are actually cofounders.
        </p>

        <p>
          From my experience, I don't think founder mode can be practiced by
          equal cofounders.
        </p>

        <p>Yet, this goes against Y Combinator's most dogmatic advice:</p>

        <p>Have co-founders, and–ideally–make yourselves equals.</p>

        <h2>Why, YC, why?</h2>

        <p>
          YC states that there are three main reasons to have a co-founder when
          starting a company:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Productivity increases</li>
          <li>Emotional and moral support</li>
          <li>
            Statistics. In their own words: "While iconic companies are often
            associated with a single famous figure, it's important to remember
            that at their earliest stages, even companies like Apple, Facebook,
            Google, and Microsoft all began with co-founders."
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In the same video, YC states that "when deciding on equity allocation
          between co-founders, the default starting point should typically be a
          50/50 split. This equal division is ideal for early-stage startups
          where both founders are expected to contribute equally and need to be
          equally motivated…Even if one founder has made initial progress,
          giving a potential great co-founder an equal 50% share can be the best
          decision to ensure their full commitment and motivation throughout the
          startup journey."
        </p>

        <p>
          This advice is wrong. I believe that the best companies–like Apple,
          Facebook, Google, and Microsoft–are founded by a single person, who
          has enough "rizz" to convince others that they are co-founders without
          actually making them equals.
        </p>

        <p>If this advice is wrong, why does YC advocate so strongly for it?</p>

        <p>
          One reason may be that having cofounders requires you to have
          convinced at least one other person to join you on your journey. This
          acts as a filter so that YC doesn't have to review as many
          applications. It also requires non-technical founders–most would-be
          applicants–to invest the time in finding a technical co-founder,
          spreading the gospel of YC on their behalf.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I don't think that's the core motivation. I think the core
          motivation, as Nassim Taleb explains in The Most Intolerant Wins: The
          Dictatorship of the Small Minority, is because having co-founders with
          an equal split gives YC all of the power. And which institution–or
          founder–doesn't like power?
        </p>

        <p>
          If you own 49% of a company and your enemy owns 49% of the company,
          who has all the power? Whoever owns the remaining 2%. They get to
          choose the leader, and kick out the other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Founder Mode, though, cannot be implemented in such a scenario. It
          requires one person with almost dictatorial control instilled in them
          by the board to make hard, disagreeable decisions in pursuit of
          "truth"–product-market fit, or free cash flow. Founders who exhibit
          founder mode too early or too late tend to get fired.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or maybe, it is because YC itself is a partnership no longer led by
          its founder, and so can't enact founder mode itself. Its founder can
          only point the way and wait for them to change. Maybe, YC will change
          these cofounder guidelines soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or maybe, YC is right and I'm wrong. Having equal cofounders is the
          best way to start and run a business. Maybe not for the founders, but
          for the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because while god mode has the chance of resurrecting flailing
          companies, it can also kill them.
        </p>

        <h2>Solo founder mode</h2>

        <p>Dictators are not always benevolent.</p>

        <p>
          Recently, WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg banned millions of
          customers from accessing WordPress resources due to a dispute with one
          of the largest-WordPress hosting sites, WP Engine. As part of
          Automattic Alignment, 159 people, or 8.4% of the company, left the
          company.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's ugly when someone like Matt Mullenwag uses his dictator status to
          change WordPress against the best wishes of its users, but maybe it's
          also necessary.
        </p>

        <p>The company may even lose, but society eventually wins.</p>

        <p>
          Perhaps Founder Mode–even when misapplied–allows one human's
          selfishness to continue the process of creative destruction that leads
          to the best tools for civilization at the best possible prices.
        </p>

        <p>
          (Or maybe Matt's right, and we'll all realize that several years from
          now. He may know something none of the rest of us knows.)
        </p>

        <p>
          In any case, I believe that this dictatorial way of running businesses
          will get much more popular as software eats the world, AI eats
          software, and founders use all of these advancements to scale their
          skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can speak from experience. I started Gumroad as a solo founder in
          2011, raised two rounds of venture in 2011 and 2012, and–after failing
          to raise a third round–laid everyone except myself off in 2015.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before that, the team helped me automate as much as possible so that I
          could run the business myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          As part of a failed attempt to sell the business in 2017, I put
          together a one-pager with what manual tasks remained:
        </p>

        <img src="/god-mode.png" alt="Gumroad tasks" />

        <p>
          Before I had to make these hard decisions, I thought I needed certain
          people. It wasn't until I was forced to make these decisions that I
          realized that I didn't really–I could do it all myself. It wasn't fun,
          but it was possible–and it led to a much healthier business–albeit a
          much less healthier me.
        </p>

        <p>For Airbnb, this is only the beginning of a long process.</p>

        <p>
          Airbnb is a public company and what matters most now is Free Cash
          Flow. I think they'll get there the same way Gumroad did: by replacing
          every manual process with an automated one, by pushing all marginal
          costs to the customer, and having almost no employees.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, humans are necessary for stellar customer service, crisis
          management, regulatory compliance and negotiations, property
          inspections–but it won't be long until AI can do all of the above.
        </p>

        <p>
          If software eats the world, and AI eats software, what remains for
          non-founders to do?
        </p>

        <h2>Gov mode</h2>

        <p>
          Most people don't want to be founders, and most founders don't want to
          do it solo.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people love their 9-5, and aren't going to advocate for them
          being eliminated, even if that's the right thing for the business or
          the world.
        </p>

        <p>So where do we go from here?</p>

        <p>
          Personally, I don't think it's the founders' job to figure that out;
          it's the government's. Social welfare programs should continue to
          expand as they always have in the face of more and more automation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For my part, I've changed the name of Gumroad's parent company from
          Gumroad to Antiwork, to make it clear what my focus is: eliminating
          the unfun parts of work–which is almost all of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, I'm done with hiring product designers and software
          engineers. Instead, I've started prototyping our first hardware
          product–something I can't have omniscience about.
        </p>

        <p>If that works, perhaps we'll start hiring again.</p>

        <p>We'll see how it goes.</p>
